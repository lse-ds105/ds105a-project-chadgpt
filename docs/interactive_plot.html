Pat the chicken tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Set up your dredging station:**\n\n1. Set out three shallow dishes. To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.\n\n**Preheat the oil:**\n\n1. Add about \u00bc inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.\n\n**Dredge the chicken:**\n\n1. Dip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess. Finish dredging the chicken by rolling it gently in the panko; gently press it into the tender to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a baking rack. Continue until all tenders are dredged.\n\n**Heat the sauce:**\n\n1. Simmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.\n\n**Fry the chicken tenders:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350\u00baF.\n2. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165\u00baF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**Sauce the tenders:**\n\n1. Once all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.\n2. Add the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Transfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions.

Place the milk, cream, half the sugar, vanilla pod &amp; salt into a medium sized saucepan. Set over a low heat &amp; warm until steaming (don't boil!).\n2. In the meantime, add the egg yolks, remaining sugar, milk powder &amp; cornflour into a heatproof mixing bowl &amp; whisk to combine.\n3. Pour a third of the warm milk into the yolks &amp; whisk them together.\n4.  Pour the tempered yolks into the pan of remaining milk &amp; cook over a low heat until thickened &amp; has reached a temperature of 82\u00b0c. Make sure to stir the custard constantly with a rubber spatula to stop it from catching. 5. Pass the custard into a jug, through a sieve then serve immediately.\n\n**Toffee Sauce**\n\n1. Place the cream, sugar, butter &amp; golden syrup into a medium sized saucepan then place over a low heat.\n2. Cook until the butter has melted &amp; the sugar has dissolved then increase the heat &amp; bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes then remove from the heat &amp; stir in the vanilla &amp; salt. Set aside &amp; leave to cool. 2. Next, grease the pudding moulds with softened butter then add a tablespoon of toffee sauce into the bottom of each one. Set aside in the fridge until ready to use.\n\n**The Sponge**\n\n1. Preheat an oven to 170\u00b0c/150\u00b0c fan (340\u00b0f/300\u00b0f fan).\n2. Chop the dates into small pieces &amp; place into a bowl with the bicarbonate of soda &amp; boiling water. Leave to soak for 10-15 minutes then blitz with a stick blender/food processor until smooth.\n3. In the meantime, sift together the flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon &amp; salt. Set aside.\n4. Place the softened butter &amp; sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer then use the paddle attachment to beat until light &amp; fluffy. This will take at least 5 minutes on a medium speed.\n5. Next, mix in the egg, followed by the black treacle.\n6. Add in half of the flour &amp; half of the date puree &amp; mix until just combined.\n7. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula then add in the remaining flour, dates &amp; the sour cream. Mix until just combined.\n8. Transfer the cake batter into a large jug then pour an equal amount into each mould.\n9. Place the moulds onto a baking tray then bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean.\n10. Once cooked, leave to cool for 5 minutes then use a sharp, serrated knife to trim each sponge level to the top of the mould.\n11. Tip each sponge out onto a plate then pour over some hot toffee sauce.\n\n**To warm up the sauce, heat on high in a microwave until bubbling or warm in a saucepan over a medium heat.**", "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Recipe", "author": "saltbuttersmoke_", "created_utc": 1693141244000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/paybhqwl6nkb1.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/162ok09/sticky_toffee_pudding_with_toasted_milk_vanilla/", "bbcgf_title": "Ultimate sticky toffee pudding", "calories": 697, "salt": 1.099609375, "fat": 36.0, "sugars": 71.0, "saturates": 21.0, "carbs": 92.0, "protein": 6.0, "fibre": 2.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9799804688}, {"id": "162i7t8", "title": "Mexican Hot Chocolate Cookies", "gpt_ingredients": ["flour ap", "dutch process cocoa powder", "cinnamon, ground", "baking powder", "baking soda", "chili powder", "vanilla sugar", "salt", "butter", "sugar white granulated", "eggs", "confectioner\u2019s sugar"], "cuisine": "mexican.", "ingredient_comment": "These Mexican hot chocolate cookies are my cookie version of the delicious spiced hot chocolate found in Mexico. \n\nThese cookies are quite cake-y, I'd say less dense than a brownie but not as airy or moist as a cake.

Deglazing the Skillet:** Pour the white wine into the skillet and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour this mixture into the slow cooker.\n\n**5. Cooking:** Add stock, the vegetables will release moisture as they cook. Cover and cook on the low setting for 6-8 hours or high setting for 3-4 hours (or until the meats are tender and flavours melded).\n\n**6. Final Adjustments:** Once done, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. If you desire a thicker sauce, you can thicken it with cornflour mixed with water.\n\n**7. Serving:** Serve the Chilindr\u00f3n with rice, potatoes, or crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.

Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add a liberal pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Scoop out \u00bd cup of the cooking water and set it aside. Drain the potatoes.\n2. Combine the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, chives, garlic powder, white pepper, and 2 tablespoons butter in a large bowl. Add \u00bc cup of the potato cooking water and whisk until combined. The butter does not need to be completely melted. \n3. Add the cooked potatoes and use a masher to mash until mostly smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper. Add more of the potato cooking water or a splash of heavy cream as needed and continue mashing until the potatoes reach your desired consistency. Cover the bowl with foil and keep the potatoes warm.\n\n**Cook the pancetta:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400\u00baF.\n2. Add the pancetta to a large, cold oven-proof wide pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook for 6\u20138 minutes, stirring frequently, until the pancetta is very crispy. Remove the pancetta from the pot using a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan.\n\n**Caramelize the shallots:**\n\n1. In the same pot over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot and shimmering, add the shallots, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes until the shallots begin to brown. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar on top and continue cooking over low to medium-low heat (adjust the heat periodically as they cook) for 10 minutes more until evenly browned. Shallots burn very easily, so keep an eye on them!\n2. Remove the shallots from the pot and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate. Season to taste with a sprinkle of salt. Carefully wipe out the skillet.\n\n**Cook the pork tenderloin:**\n\n1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pot over medium-high. Once hot, add the pork tenderloin and cook for 3\u20134 minutes per side until the entire tenderloin is well-seared.\n2. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook for an additional 15\u201318 minutes or until the pork reaches 135\u00baF at the thickest part. Remove the pot from the oven, transfer the tenderloin to a cutting board, and rest for 10 minutes. After the pork has rested, thinly slice and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.\n\n**Make the spinach:**\n\n1. Return the pot used for the pork tenderloin to the stove over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the minced garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n2. Pour in the chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\n3. Add the spinach and cook for 2\u20134 minutes, stirring regularly, until the spinach wilts. Add the lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and black pepper. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving platter and top with the spinach and a few spoonfuls of the pan sauce. Arrange the sliced pork tenderloin on top. Garnish with the crispy pancetta, browned shallots, and minced parsley. Spoon the remaining pan sauce on top of the pork.

During this cook time, immersion blend or stir together the Maple Syrup, Brown Mustard, and Apple Cider Vinegar. \n7.

Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Turn off the heat and add the mushrooms. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and dice them.\n\n**Prepare the vegetables:**\n\n1. Dice all of the vegetables needed for the fried rice. Place the baby bella mushrooms in one bowl and combine the white parts of the scallions, the yellow onion, bell pepper, and carrots in a bowl.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, 2 tablespoons mushroom soaking water, minced ginger, white pepper, and crushed red pepper in a bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.\n\n**Make the fried rice:**\n\n1. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced baby bella mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes until golden brown.\n2. Add the bowl of diced vegetables (scallions, onion, pepper, and carrots) to the wok with the mushrooms and season lightly with salt. Cook, turning often, for 3\u20135 minutes until the carrots soften and the onions are translucent.\n3. Add the diced shiitake mushrooms and cook for 1 minute.\n4. Add the cooked rice to the wok and break it up with a metal spatula. Turn regularly, being careful not to mush up the rice too much. It should make good contact with the skillet or wok. Cook the rice for 5 minutes until it crisps up in spots.\n5. Make a well in the middle of the rice. Pour in the sauce, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat back to medium. Use your spatula to toss the rice in the sauce for 1\u20133 minutes until well-coated. Stir in green scallion parts and cook for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the fried rice between shallow bowls and serve the remaining scallion greens on top. Enjoy!\n\n**Recipe notes:**\n\n\\*If you don\u2019t have day-old rice, make 3 cups cooked rice from 1 cup dry. Rinse 1 cup of dry rice and combine with 2 cups water and a few shakes of salt in a small pot. Bring to a boil, stir once, cover, and simmer on low heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 5\u201310 minutes. Transfer to a sheet pan or pour into a large bowl and spread into an even layer (up the sides of the bowl if not using a sheet pan).

Then let everything cool down to room temperature or until it doesn't feel warm to the touch (be careful not to leave it too long so the mixture doesn't set). \n6. Whip the cup (240g) of heavy milk (better if it's chilled) in a big bowl until stiff peaks, and then add the melted chocolate and mix until combined. \n7. Add the mixture to the pan with the crust, and even it out. Leave it in the fridge until the next layer. \n8. For the strawberry layer, add the strawberries to a food processor and blend until they are liquid. (Optional: After it's liquid, pass it through a sieve in case you don't want seeds.) \n9. Place three gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. \n10. Add the strawberry liquid and 1/4 cup (50g) of sugar to a medium-heat pan and stir until the sugar is mixed (a few mins).\n11. Place the resulting liquid into a bowl, add the gelatin sheets, and mix it really well. Then leave it in the fridge until it's not warm to the touch, around 30\u201360 minutes. If the gelatin has started to set, whisk well until smooth and loose again. \n12. Whip the 1 + 1/4 cup (300g in total) of heavy milk (better if it's cold) until stiff peaks, and then add the strawberry mixture and mix until combined. \n13. Add the mixture over the first chocolate layer and leave it for at least 3 hours. \n14. To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife along the edges of the pan.\n15.  You can add optional cacao powder on top of the cake.", "score": 182, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Dessert", "author": "OlegsKitchen", "created_utc": 1691604409000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/we0em3le94hb1.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15ml4fi/strawberry_chocolate_mousse_cake_recipe/", "bbcgf_title": "Strawberry & white chocolate mousse cake", "calories": 737, "salt": 0.8901367188, "fat": 59.0, "sugars": 35.0, "saturates": 35.0, "carbs": 47.0, "protein": 8.0, "fibre": 2.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9599609375}, {"id": "13zct45", "title": "Salted Caramel Chocolate Bark", "gpt_ingredients": ["sugar", "cream", "golden corn syrup", "butter", "salt", "hot cream", "vanilla extract", "chocolate", "butter", "roasted nuts", "pretzels", "sea salt"], "cuisine": "american", "ingredient_comment": "For the complet video recipe \u27a1[Homemade Salted Caramel Chocolate Bark](https://youtu.be/ijeI6BasAmw)\n\n# Ingredients\n\nCaramel:\n\n* 3/4 cup (150g) sugar\n* 1/3 cup (75g) cream\n* 1/3 cup (105g) golden corn syrup\n* 3 tablespoons (42g) butter\n* 1/4 teaspoon (1.5g) salt\n* 1/3 cup (75g) hot cream\n* 1/4 teaspoon (1.5g) vanilla extract\n\nBark:\n\n* 3 cups (510g) chocolate (your favorite)\n* 2 teaspoons (9g) butter\n* 1 1/2 cups (210g) roasted nuts (your favorite) OR 3 cups (210g) pretzels (whole)\n* Sea salt (to taste)\n\n#", "score": 277, "upvote_ratio": 0.9501953125, "link_flair_text": "Dessert", "author": "whipped-desserts", "created_utc": 1685802258000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/bfbowiqw0t3b1.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13zct45/salted_caramel_chocolate_bark/", "bbcgf_title": "Easy chocolate bark", "calories": 116, "salt": 0.1300048828, "fat": 7.0, "sugars": 6.0, "saturates": 4.0, "carbs": 10.0, "protein": 2.0, "fibre": 2.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.8798828125}, {"id": "13xda9o", "title": "Polish Summer Fruit Cake", "gpt_ingredients": ["plain flour", "butter", "eggs", "granulated white sugar", "baking powder", "salt", "vanilla bean paste", "fresh fruit (strawberry, blueberry, rhubarb, apricots)", "plain flour", "granulated white sugar", "butter", "13x9 inch baking tray", "parchment paper", "mixing bowl", "standing mixer or hand mixer", "spatula", "cooling rack"], "cuisine": "polish", "ingredient_comment": "Family recipe for a delicious and versatile cake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Preparation time:** 15 minutes\n\n**Baking time:** 40-45 minutes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for cake:**\n\n\\* 11.3oz plain flour, sieved (all purpose flour) 320g\n\n\\* 7oz of butter (room temp) 200g\n\n\\*8.8oz eggs (4 large, room temp) 250g\n\n\\* 6.3oz granulated white sugar, 180g\n\n\\* 2 flat tsp of baking powder\n\n\\* pinch of salt\n\n\\* 1tsp vanilla bean paste\n\n\\* 800g of fresh fruit (Strawberry, blueberry, rhubarb, apricots)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for crumble topping:**\n\n\\* plain flour 150g\n\n\\* granulated white sugar 120g\n\n\\* butter 120g\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Equipment:**\n\n\\* 13x9 inch baking tray (33cm x 23cm) If you prefer, you can also use a slightly smaller tray for this recipe.

Prepare a baking tray by greasing it lightly with oil and lining it with parchment paper to keep it in place.\n\n**2.** For the cake batter, in a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy. Reduce the speed to medium and gradually add the eggs one by one, ensuring they are well incorporated. Then, add the vanilla bean paste.\n\n**3.** Stop the mixer and add the sifted flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low speed until the ingredients are fully incorporated. If the mixture appears too thick, add two tablespoons of milk or water and incorporate it.\n\n**4.** Using a spatula, transfer the batter to the prepared baking tray and spread it evenly. Arrange the fruit on top; you can halve the strawberries, cut the rhubarb into chunks, and quarter the apricots.\n\n**5.** To prepare the crumble topping, place all the crumble ingredients in a bowl and rub the mixture between your fingers until it is almost combined. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the fruit.\n\n**6.** Place the baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.\n\n**7.** Once the cake is ready, allow it to cool for 10 minutes before serving. You can transfer it to a cooling rack, using a sheet of paper and the help of another person to expedite the cooling process.\n\n**8.** Enjoy your delicious cake with a cup of coffee!

Combine the chopped rhubarb, \u00bd cup sugar, and \u00bd cup water in a medium pot and bring to a boil.\n2. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30\u201345 minutes until very soft.\n3. Use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. You may also use a traditional blender or food processor. Just pour the mixture back into the pot.\n4. Let the rhubarb cool completely. Add the food coloring, if using, and mix well to incorporate.\n5. Remove \u00bd cup of the rhubarb mixture from the pot and reserve for the homemade ice cream.\n\n**Make the ice cream:**\n\n1. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a medium mixing bowl and add the vanilla extract. Stir to combine.\n2. Pour the heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, mix on medium speed until thick, stiff peaks form.\n3. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into the heavy cream and gently fold everything together with a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix!\n4. Pour the cream mixture into an 8-inch cake pan or loaf pan. Drizzle the reserved \u00bd cup of rhubarb on top and use the rubber spatula to swirl and mix into the cream gently.\n5. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap. The wrap should be completely in contact with the ice cream without air bubbles. Use your hands to pat it down as tightly as possible. If there are air bubbles, ice crystals will form and make the top of your ice cream icy. Be sure the wrap is in contact with the ice cream from edge to edge. Transfer to the freezer until it is completely frozen, at least 4 hours.\n\n**Prepare the tart crust:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Place the pecans in a food processor and pulse them into a fine meal. Transfer to a mixing bowl with the flour and powdered sugar. Add \u00bc teaspoon salt.\n3. Melt the butter in the microwave or a small saucepan over the stovetop. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Let stand for 5 minutes. Pour the butter into the bowl of flour and pecans and use a rubber spatula to mix until there are no dry bits of flour and the dough is smooth and moist.\n4. Place the dough into a 10\u201d greased pie dish or tart pan. Use your hands to smooth it into the dish and up the sides in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes. Remove and let stand for 30 minutes. Keep the oven at 350\u00baF.\n\n**Finish the filling:**\n\n1. Add the egg yolks and remaining \u00bd cup sugar to the pot of the remaining rhubarb. Turn the heat back to medium and whisk until completely smooth.\n2. Add the cold, cubed butter and continue whisking until the heat melts the butter completely. It will take 2\u20133 minutes of regular whisking. Continue whisking until completely smooth. Turn off the heat and immediately pour into the prepared crust.\n\n**Bake the tart:**\n\n1. Transfer the tart to the oven for 15 minutes; carefully rotate the tart once midway through cooking.\n2. After 15 minutes, remove from the oven and do a jiggle check. It should be set up around the edges and slightly jiggly in the middle. It should wobble, not slosh. If it\u2019s still very jiggly around the edges, return to the oven and continue baking in 2-minute increments until the tart is set around the edges but still jiggly in the middle. It should not need more than 20 minutes in the oven.\n\n**Finish the tart:**\n\n1. Let the tart stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight before serving.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Slice the tart and carefully remove each piece. If you made this in a pie dish, it will be more difficult to serve but not impossible! Dust the tart with powdered sugar and serve with rhubarb ice cream on top.

In a stand mixer or in a separate bowl with an electric mixer, cream the butter with the brown and granulated sugar thoroughly. \n4. Add eggs, one at a time., and mix well in between.\n5. Add vanilla extract and mix.\n6. Add the dry ingredients and mix on low just until incorporated. \n7. Remove bowl from mixer and stir in the chocolate chips by hand just until evenly distributed.\n8.

I would also really appreciate any follows on social media channels if you like the site!\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 6 large egg whites\n* 335g caster sugar (super fine sugar in the US)\n* 300ml rich double cream\n* 180ml lemon curd\n* 250g raspberries\n* 250g blueberries\n* 70g crushed de-shelled pistachios\n* 2 passion fruit\n* fresh mint\n\n**METHOD**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 150\u00b0C (300\u00b0F). Line a flat tray with parchment paper, you will be baking the meringue on this and don't want it to stick to the surface. I use a 38cm \u00d7 35cm tray, but you can use any large flat rectangular tray that will fit into your oven. You will be rolling along the longer edge, so this will be the finished length of your roulade.\n2. Add the egg whites and half the caster sugar to a bowl, making sure that it's clean and completely dry before beginning. If there is any moisture left in the bowl, the egg whites won't form. whisk the mixture until it's formed light peaks. Once they have formed, gradually add the other half of the sugar until it forms stiff glossy peaks. This will take about 10-15 minutes. \n3. Spread the meringue mixture evenly onto the lined tray, squaring off the edges as best you can. Place in the oven and bake for one hour. It should be a very light golden colour when it's done. \n4. Remove tray from the oven and turn upside down onto a fresh sheet of parchment paper. Carefully peel off the backing sheet, working slowly and with a knife to scrape the paper gently away in one piece. There will be pockets of carmelised sugar stuck to the paper you want to get all those pieces off as they add a lovely gooey texture. \n5. Whip the double cream until thick and gently fold in the lemon curd, keeping the air you've incorporated during whipping. Spread the cream and curd mix over the flat meringue and cover with a layer of raspberries and blueberries, about 2/3 of the amount. \n6. Make a light score with a knife about 2cm in along one long edge of the meringue, this is going to help you as a starting point to roll it. From the indent, gently roll inwards away from yourself, using the paper underneath to help turn it as you go. You shouldn't be touching the surface of the meringue with your hands, use the paper to do that for you. The \"seam' will sit on the bottom once it's rolled. The outer surface will crack a little bit, you can patch it up if need be once it's served. \n7. When the roll is almost complete, grab the paper and use it to help you transfer the roulade to a plate. It's helpful if you have someone to give you a hand shifting it onto the serving plate, they can hold the plate steady while you transfer. Decorate with the remaining berries, crushed pistachios, passion fruit and mint.", "score": 1090, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Dessert", "author": "leviathanfood", "created_utc": 1669688484000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/d92lbhgivs2a1.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z7gjk9/meringue_roulade_with_lemon_curd_berries_crushed/", "bbcgf_title": "Almond & lemon meringue roulade", "calories": 394, "salt": 0.0999755859, "fat": 25.0, "sugars": 36.0, "saturates": 13.0, "carbs": 38.0, "protein": 4.0, "fibre": 0.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9599609375}, {"id": "z4dz1m", "title": "Chocolate Dipped Peppermint Meringues", "gpt_ingredients": ["egg whites", "sugar granulated or caster", "cream of tartar", "salt", "vanilla extract", "peppermint extract", "red gel food colouring", "semi-sweet chocolate melted", "peppermint candies"], "cuisine": "dessert.", "ingredient_comment": "RECIPE: https://themindfulmeringue.com/chocolate-dipped-peppermint-meringues/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n* 4 Egg Whites large\n* 1 cup Sugar Granulated or Caster\n* 1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar\n* 1/4 tsp Salt\n* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract\n* 1/2 tsp Peppermint Exact\n* Red Gel Food Colouring optional\n* 1 cup (140g) Semi-sweet Chocolate melted\n* 1 cup (150g) Peppermint Candies", "score": 2073, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Dessert", "author": "ferociousbutrfly", "created_utc": 1669384549000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/q2zrdgqor32a1.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z4dz1m/chocolate_dipped_peppermint_meringues/", "bbcgf_title": "Chocolate peppermint mini rolls", "calories": 348, "salt": 0.3000488281, "fat": 21.0, "sugars": 25.0, "saturates": 12.0, "carbs": 33.0, "protein": 5.0, "fibre": 3.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9599609375}, {"id": "yza7qm", "title": "Rum Fruit Cake", "gpt_ingredients": ["egg", "softened butter", "caster sugar", "cake flour", "salt", "chopped pecans", "mixed fruits", "orange peel", "rum", "mixed spice"], "cuisine": "british", "ingredient_comment": "#####Preparation time: 10 minutes\n#####Cooking time: 35 minutes\n#####Serving Size: 1 Egg\n\n#INGREDIENTS \n - 1 Egg (65g with shell)\n - 60g Softened Butter (unsalted)\n - 40g Caster Sugar\n - 50g Cake Flour\n - A Pinch Of Salt\n - 15g Chopped Pecans\n - 50g Mixed Fruits\n - 0.5 tsp Orange Peel\n - 25g Rum\n - 5g Cake Flour (for mixed fruits)\n - 0.5 tsp Mixed Spice\n - 20g Rum (for brushing the cake)\n\n#", "score": 304, "upvote_ratio": 0.9902343750000001, "link_flair_text": "Dessert", "author": "juicyorange520", "created_utc": 1668858920000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/nn7qj0tcux0a1.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/yza7qm/rum_fruit_cake/", "bbcgf_title": "Pineapple & rum cake", "calories": 459, "salt": 0.5, "fat": 20.0, "sugars": 49.0, "saturates": 12.0, "carbs": 61.0, "protein": 1.0, "fibre": 5.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9399414062}, {"id": "yv8hjs", "title": "Basic fudgy brownies", "gpt_ingredients": ["butter", "plain flour", "sugar", "cocoa powder", "eggs", "baking soda", "vanilla extract/flavouring", "salt", "chocolate chunks"], "cuisine": "brownies", "ingredient_comment": "\nIngredients:\n\n\u2022 250grams butter\n\n\u2022 1 and 1/3 cup plain flour\n\n\u2022 2 and 1/4 cup sugar\n\n\u2022 3/4 cup cocoa powder\n\n\u2022 4 eggs\n\n\u2022 1/2 teaspoon baking soda \n\n\u2022 1 teaspoon vanilla extract/flavouring\n\n\u2022 Pinch of salt\n\nMethod:\n\n1. preheat fan/convection oven to 170degrees Celsius (350 f)\n\n2.

Sprinkle 3 tbsp of nut mixture over the top half of the Fillo sheets.\n2. Place two bamboo skewers across the middle of the Fillo sheet. Fold Fillo in half over the skewers. Slowly roll the Fillo over the skewers, away from you to form a log. Gently press ends of the log in towards the centre to create a wrinkled effect and to complete the log. Pick up the log, place in the tray and remove the bamboo skewers. Butter each log as you complete to prevent them from drying out.\n3. Repeat with remaining Fillo Pastry and nut mixture until the tray is full. Cut the saragli into thirds and then pour over remaining butter.\n4. Bake in preheated oven for 45 mins or until golden brown.\n5. Remove Saragli from the oven and pour over cooled syrup immediately.

Prepare a 18cm(7-inch) baking pan; set aside.\n\n2.Sift dry ingredients together. Place sugar, eggs and salt into a mixer bowl and whisk until light and fluffy. Add dry ingredients(in 2 batches) into the batter and mix on a low speed. Add milk and melted butter and continue mixing. At the end add boiling water and mix until well combined.\n\n3.Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and put it in the oven and bake for 40min until done.

When the cake is completely cooled, cover it with plastic cling wrap and put in the fridge to rest overnight.\n\n4.Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Put the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring it to a gentle boil. Do not stir the caramel. Gently swirl the pot to even out the sauce. Cook the caramel until it is a golden-brown color.

Using a round piping nozzle, pipe a ring of frosting around the edge of the cake.Spread a layer of the caramel in the middle of the cake, then sprinkle with crushed shortcake biscuits. Repeat for the next layer.\n\n7.Top the cake with the final layer, and spread the cream cheese frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Use a palette knife or cake side scraper to take off the excess buttercream and give a smooth finish. Chill the frosted cake for 15 minutes in the fridge, to allow the layer of frosting to firm up.\n\n8.Add another layer of frosting to the top and sides of the cake, and remove the excess. Chill the frosted cake for another 15 minutes in the fridge.\n\n9.Pour heavy cream into a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave on high until very hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chocolate chips to heated cream; whisk until smooth. Set aside to firm up a little \u2013 you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny.\n\n10.Fill the piping bag or squeeze bottle with the ganache you\u2019ve made.

I choose one cover with chocolate to add another layer of love to the recipe.\n\nBe very careful not to add too much butter to the base as this will solidify it too much and you will not be able to dig in.

It is a sin worthy dessert! I always recommend vanilla bean paste over the extract but use what's in your cupboard and it will still taste superb. You can also add any type of citrus zest that you like to create another layer of freshness in this dessert.\n\n**Garnish**\n\nIf you go for simplicity and a more classical look cocoa powder is just fine.

I love it because it's no-mess...you don't have to dice them or blanch them and you won't have skins in the sauce.\n\nYou just grate on the large holes of a box grater and you can whizz through a bunch of tomatoes in like 5 mins. You want to use juicy, super ripe tomatoes...avoid Roma tomatoes as they are too dry/firm.\n\nI use this process for homemade salsa because honestly, i just hate chopping up tomatoes (I have slight eczema on my fingers and the acidity of tomatoes really effs up my fingers) so grating is a really nice way to prep them for me!\n\nJust be mindful that there's a LOT of water in the grated tomatoes so you want to cook it off.

Cut off a very thin slice from the bottom of the tomatoes.\n2. Grate the tomatoes into a large bowl using the large holes of a box grater. Discard the skins.\n\n**Cook the sausage:**\n\n1. Heat a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the sausage and cook, breaking it up periodically, for 12\u201315 minutes until cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and drain off all but a teaspoon of the oil in the pot.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the onion. Cook for 5\u20137 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and zucchini and fry for 1\u20132 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper to taste.\n2. Return the sausage to the pot and pour in the grated tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20\u201330 minutes or until the sauce is thick. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The grated tomatoes make quite a bit of excess water, so you want to cook it all off!  Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Boil the pasta:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add a generous amount of salt and the rigatoni. Cook until 1-2 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water and drain the pasta.\n\n**Finish the pasta:**\n\n1. Taste the sauce and season once more. Add the baby spinach, lemon juice, and cooked pasta. Toss to coat for 2\u20133 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and toss to coat for 1 minute more. Add pasta water if needed to loosen up the sauce and coat the pasta. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Sprinkle more Parmesan on each plate.

Cook until al dente. Scoop out 1/2 cup of the water and set aside. Drain the pasta.\n\n**Finish the sauce:**\n\n1. Stir the ricotta and spinach into the tomato sauce. As soon as the spinach begins to wilt, add the pasta and toss to coat. Add the pasta water as needed to loosen up the sauce so that it coats the pasta evenly. Taste and season once more.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the cooked pasta between shallow bowls. Garnish with parmesan cheese, fresh basil, and black pepper.

The next morning Mars and Bacchus moved away from the inn leaving Venus dormant;\n\nWhen she woke up, she called the other companions to hear where they were. the innkeeper came to see if he could help and saw the little-dressed goddess was so impressed by its splendid shapes that he returned to the kitchen and created a pasta inspired by Venus' navel\u2026and so was born the Tortellini.\n\nAs usual if you like the recipe and want to subscribe you are welcome\n\nVideo recipe [HERE](https://youtu.be/pM37CxZdXhk)\n\nServing for about 6 persons\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\nFor the filling\n\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) pork loin\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) mortadella\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )\n* 150 gr ( 5.29 ounce ) grated parmigiano\n* 10 gr ( 0.35 ounce )  butter\n* 2 eggs\n* nutmeg\n* black pepper\n* salt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the dough\n\n* 320 gr ( 11.29 ounce ) all-purpose  flour\n* 80 gr ( 2.82 ounce ) semolina flour\n* 4 eggs\n* 25 gr ( 0.88 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil\n* salt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INSTRUCTION**\n\n* in a pan put 10 gr butter and 100 gr pork loin diced\n* let the pork loin brown well and drain from the excess of butter\n* in a meat grinder put the pork loin, 100 gr mortadella and 100 gr cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )\n* add to the mixture half nutmeg grated, 150 gr grated parmigiano, black pepper and 2 eggs\n* Mix well the mixture and add salt if needed ( you should taste the mixture because the flavor can vary depending on the type of cured ham and mortadella)\n* cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours\n\nNow let's prepare the homemade pasta as usual so 1 egg every 100 gr flours. For the flours we will use all-purpose and semolina flour in a proportion 4 to 1 so for this filling about 320 gr all-purpose and 80 gr semolina flour\n\n* Put the flours on a pastry board making a hole in the center where you will put 4 whole eggs and 25 gr extra virgin olive oil.\n* With a fork amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated, salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.\n* work the dough until it is smooth and even. Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.\n* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part\n* now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough\n* the dough will be ready when it is less of one millimetre thick. I usually use the lower setting of thickness\n* now cut the pasta dough to obtain squares 4 cm long, i use a pasta cutter to obtain several squares at the time and speed up the process\n* Take a pasta square and put a little of filling in the middle then fold the square into a triangle. Finally, roll up the triangle and join the angles creating the typical shape of the tortellini like you can see in the video\n* if the pasta dries too much you can moisten the edges of the dough square with a finger wetted in a little water. this will help to seal the tortellini.\n* Put the tortellini on a tray lined with parchment paper. If you want you can also frozen tortellini, to do so put the tray in freezer a few hours, in this way they will remain intact and will not stick during freezing, when the tortellini are well frozen you can transfer them in bags to save space in the freezer\n* Cook tortellini into boiling beef and poultry stock. If frozen, do not unfreeze.\n* You can also prepare tortellini without broth. Cook them in abundant salted water, when they are ready ( 4/5 minutes usually) drain them and season with a heavy cream sauce with ham and peas. If you want more precise instruction for this kind of seasoning ask in the comment section\n\nThat's all if you have any question feel free to ask and Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas  in advance \\^\\_\\^", "score": 3896, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Pasta", "author": "italian_cook", "created_utc": 1608766721000, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kj42wh", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kj42wh/homemade_italian_tortellini/", "bbcgf_title": "Tortellini with pesto & broccoli", "calories": 573, "salt": 1.580078125, "fat": 26.0, "sugars": 8.0, "saturates": 9.0, "carbs": 64.0, "protein": 24.0, "fibre": 5.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9399414062}, {"id": "kbegtk", "title": "Pork &amp; Fennell Sausage Pasta", "gpt_ingredients": ["4 pork and fennel sausages", "1 large onion finely diced", "3 large garlic cloves crushed", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 cup white wine", "1/2 cup chicken stock", "200g baby spinach", "1 teaspoon chilli flakes", "pinch of pepper", "300g orecchiette"], "cuisine": "italian", "ingredient_comment": "## Recipe: [https://www.daenskitchen.com/blog/pork-amp-fennel-sausage-orecchiette-with-wilted-greens-amp-chilli](https://www.daenskitchen.com/blog/pork-amp-fennel-sausage-orecchiette-with-wilted-greens-amp-chilli)\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 4 pork and fennel sausages\n* 1 large onion finely diced\n* 3 large garlic cloves crushed\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1/2 cup white wine\n* 1/2 cup chicken stock\n* 200g baby spinach\n* 1 teaspoon chilli flakes\n* Pinch of pepper\n* 300g orecchiette\n\n## Method\n\n1.

I made a few modifications to the filling based on ingredients I had readily available, but the filling is fantastic, with or without mushrooms.\n\nYou can also use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store - just make sure you finely chop it.\n\n**Roast duck:**\n\n* 4\u20135\u00a0pound\u00a0duck; giblets, neck, and feet reserved for another use\n* 1 orange, quartered\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 2-inch\u00a0piece of ginger, peeled and minced\n* 4\u00a0cloves\u00a0garlic, peeled and minced\n* 3\u00a0scallions, trimmed and minced\n* 2\u00a0Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced\n* 2\u00a0tablespoons hoisin sauce\n* 2\u00a0tablespoons thin\u00a0soy sauce\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, optional, to taste\n* \u00bd orange, juiced\n* Salt, if needed\n\n**Dumplings:**\n\n* 24\u201328 dumpling wrappers\n* Sliced scallion greens, optional, for garnish\n* Water\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* \u2153 cup black vinegar\n* 1\u20132 teaspoons chili oil\n* 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds\n\n**Prepare the duck:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.\n3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.\n4. Stuff the cavity with the orange wedges. Truss the legs with kitchen twine.\n\n**Roast the duck:**\n\n1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.\n2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6\u20138 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.\n3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.\n4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.\n\n**Prepare the filling:**\n\n1. Gather the minced ginger, garlic, scallions, and Thai chili peppers in a bowl. Add the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, orange juice, and sweet chili sauce if you like.\n\n**Shred the duck:**\n\n1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the crispy skin as you like for the dumplings, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.\n2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Your filling is finished, and you're ready to make dumplings!\n\n**Fold the dumplings:**\n\n1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.\n2. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper.\n3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape.\n4. You can crimp and pinch the edges as you seal it, but it takes practice!\n\n**Steam, pan-fry, or deep fry the dumplings:**\n\n1. To steam: fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam for 10 minutes.\n2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water just to coat the bottom, then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings, sesame seed side down, and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in \u00bc cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes. Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so.\n3. To deep-fry: Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches 330\u00baF. Add dumplings in batches and deep-fry for 3\u20134 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Make the sauce by whisking together the black vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Place the sauce in a small bowl in the middle of a serving platter. Arrange the dumplings around the sauce and garnish with sliced scallions.

I go a little longer to soften them a bit more so I don't have to saut\u00e9 them quite as long since you're holding the duck. BUT! If you don't mind dirtying another skillet, feel free to start those mushrooms and onions in a separate skillet as you cook the duck.\n\nSeared duck breast:\n\n* 1 duck breast (1 pound)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nMushrooms and pearl onions:\n\n* 8 ounces gold or white pearl onions\n* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced\n* 2 tablespoons reserved duck fat\n* 3 sprigs thyme\n* 4 garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced\n* 1 tablespoon freshly minced parsley, plus more for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nSweet potato puree:\n\n* 2 sweet potatoes, about 1 pound, peeled and cubed\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* \u00bd cup whole milk plus more, if needed\n* 2 tablespoons sour cream\n* 2 teaspoons garlic powder\n* 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper flakes or paprika and a pinch of crushed red pepper\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nParboil and peel the pearl onions:\n\n1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the pearl onions (skins on) and boil for 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl of ice-cold water using a slotted spoon.\n2. Once the onions are cool enough to handle, carefully cut off the root end of the onion with sharp scissors. Pop the onion out from its skin. Continue on until all the onions are peeled. Discard the skins.\n\nCook the sweet potatoes:\n\n1. Dump out the water from the pot and add the sweet potatoes. Cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender.\n2. Turn off the heat. Pour the potatoes into a colander and return the pot to the same burner. Allow the potatoes to dry off for 1 minute using the residual heat from the warm burner.\n3. Add the butter, milk, sour cream, garlic powder, and pepper flakes to the potatoes.\n4. Using an immersion blender, blend until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if needed. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder or pepper flakes. Set aside and keep warm.\n\nCook the duck:\n\n1. Pat the duck dry breast dry. Using a sharp paring knife, score the skin at an angle in \u215b-inch increments until the skin has been completely scored from edge to edge. Be careful not to pierce or cut into the flesh of the duck.\n2. Place the duck, skin-side down, into a skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 7 minutes or until the fat begins to render out. Adjust the heat periodically as it cooks. You want to stay somewhere between medium and medium-low.\n3. If your duck breast is unevenly fatty (for example, the ends may have a thicker fat layer than the middle of the breast), use a small cast-iron press or skillet or a metal flipper to press that part of the duck into the skillet to encourage even browning.\n4. After 7 minutes, get the heat back to medium or just slightly above. The fat in the skillet may begin bubbling and sputtering a bit more rapidly. Check the skin and continue frying and adjusting the heat until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp. This may take another 6\u20138 minutes. Just keep adjusting the heat and peeking at the skin.\n5. Flip the duck and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until desired internal temperature is met. For medium-rare, cook the duck to about 130\u00baF at the thickest part of the breast. Note: Do not take the temperature of the duck through the skin. Pierce the flesh in order to get an accurate temperature read. I prefer to cook the duck until it reaches 135\u00baF.\n6. Transfer the duck to a plate and cover it tightly with foil. Set aside to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.\n\nFry the mushrooms and onions:\n\n1. Drain all the duck fat into a heat-proof jar through a small sieve. Wipe out the skillet and place it on the stove over medium heat.\n2. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms begin to sweat and take on a bit of color.\n3. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved duck fat, pearl onions, and thyme sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until the pearl onions are fork-tender and golden around the edges.\n4. Stir in the minced garlic and fresh parsley and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.\n\nTo serve:\n\n1. Right before serving, remove the foil from the duck and slice it crosswise.\n2. Spoon the sweet potatoes into a rimmed plate and pile on the mushrooms and onions. Arrange a few slices of duck on each plate. Garnish with more parsley and Aleppo pepper flakes if you like.

You can also use cashews or almonds.\n\nDon't overcook the vegetables - To retain their texture and nutrients, don't overcook the vegetables. Add them towards the end of cooking and cook just until they're tender.\n\nAdjust the seasoning - Taste the curry as you cook it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or fish sauce to balance the flavours.", "score": 3033, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "mienczaczek", "created_utc": 1678472479000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/im7yhtuueyma1.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11nwlxk/chicken_massaman_curry/", "bbcgf_title": "Beef massaman curry", "calories": 734, "salt": 1.8701171875, "fat": 46.0, "sugars": 13.0, "saturates": 21.0, "carbs": 38.0, "protein": 44.0, "fibre": 3.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.8999023438}, {"id": "11g7ybp", "title": "Spicy Orange Chicken and Mushrooms", "gpt_ingredients": ["fresh squeezed orange juice", "orange zest", "shaoxing wine", "rice vinegar", "light brown sugar", "soy sauce", "sesame oil", "chili oil", "cornstarch", "neutral oil", "boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "cornstarch", "salt", "white pepper", "neutral oil", "shiitake mushrooms", "ginger", "garlic", "bird\u2019s eye chilies", "scallions", "sliced scallion greens", "crispy shallots", "sesame seeds", "cooked white rice"], "cuisine": "chinese", "ingredient_comment": "**More photos, tips, and substitutions can be found here:** [**Spicy Orange Chicken Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/spicy-orange-chicken-recipe/)\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* 4 ounces fresh squeezed orange juice\n* 2 teaspoons orange zest\n* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 4 tablespoons light brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1 tablespoon chili oil, optional\n* 1 tablespoon cornstarch\n\n**Chicken:**\n\n* 2\u20133 tablespoons neutral oil\n* 1\u00bd pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized cubes\n* 3 tablespoons cornstarch\n* \u00be teaspoon salt\n* \u00bc teaspoon white pepper\n\n**Aromatics:**\n\n* 2 teaspoons neutral oil, as needed, divided\n* 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, caps sliced and stems discarded\n* 2 teaspoons freshly minced ginger\n* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 2\u20133 bird\u2019s eye chilies, trimmed and minced\n* 2 scallions, minced\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* Sliced scallion greens, crispy shallots, or sesame seeds\n* Cooked white rice\n\n**Prepare all the ingredients:**\n\n1.

Prepare chicken breast\n\nPaper dry chicken breast and slice horizontally from the thicker side to a thinner, but stop about 1/2 inches to it. This way you will \"butterfly\" your chicken breast, which is a well-known technique to make thin and large chicken pieces. \n\nCover your butterflied chicken breast with a piece of plastic wrap and roll a pin over it to make it even and thinner. Set aside.\n\n2.  Make mushroom stuffing \n\nMince 5 cloves of garlic and saut\u00e9 it in a frying pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add finely chopped 2 onions, keep saut\u00e9ing for another 2 minutes. Add chopped Portobello mushroom caps to the pan and keep cooking stirring occasionally for 5 more minutes or until all water will evaporate from the pan. \n\nAdd a quarter of a cup of dry White Wine, mix well and cook until stuffing gets almost dry. \n\nAt that point add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and some fresh minced thyme. Mix well and set aside to cool down.\n\n3. Roll!\n\nPlace your chicken with a wide side down and thin side up like on the pictures below. \nDivide mushroom sauce into 3 parts: 2 for each chicken breast and 1 for the cream sauce for later. \n\nUsing a spoon, evenly spread 1 part of mushroom stuffing over the chicken piece, leaving half an inch on each side uncovered. \n\nNext, lay some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella, keep sides uncovered.\n\nGently roll chicken working your way from the wider bottom to the thinner top. Do not add too much pressure, as your stuffing will try to escape! We will secure everything in place with a cooking twine in just a second.\n\nNow it is time to wrap our roulade in prosciutto. Here is what I learned the hard way ( meaning one of the roulades on final pictures is an unsuccessful test, but still the same delicious ha!): lay prosciutto slices parallel to your chicken roll, this way it is much easier to cover the whole roulade, which will look so much better when the dish is done!\n\nTwine up! Using a cooking twine (the cotton string will work just fine!) gently wrap your roulade, starting from one side of it with tying a knot and work your way to the other side. Now you can add some pressure to help twine keep roulade`s shape while searing it. \n\n4. Sear roulade \n\nPreheat your skillet pan on medium heat. I used skillet mostly because I  wanted to be able to cook my dish both on a stovetop and in the oven, so if you have a suitable frying pan you can stick it into your cooking stove, - use that! Also, I used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to season my pan. \n\nAdd your chicken roulades into a hot pan and sear for 3 minutes on each of 4 sides.  Let it cool down for 5 minutes before proceeding to the final step.\n\n5. Sauce and bake\n\nGently remove twine by cutting each layer and pulling it.\n\nFinally, pour half a cup of heavy cream into your pan, add a third of the mushroom stuffing left from making roulades, and a little bit more cheese ( at this point you can use any cheese you love but make sure it is great melting one). \n\nPlace pan into the preheated to 370F oven and bake for 20 minutes. \nTo add some amazing color broil on High for just a minute before taking it out of the oven.", "score": 3160, "upvote_ratio": 0.9902343750000001, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "Intelligentblond", "created_utc": 1620825365000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/dsewyouqloy61.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/nan8ux/prosciuttowrapped_chicken_roulade_with_mushrooms/", "bbcgf_title": "Prosciutto-wrapped chicken & leek terrine", "calories": 322, "salt": 1.08984375, "fat": 17.0, "sugars": 2.0, "saturates": 5.0, "carbs": 4.0, "protein": 39.0, "fibre": 2.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9199218750000001}, {"id": "n1ncb8", "title": "Thai basil stir fry", "gpt_ingredients": ["boneless skinless chicken thighs", "garlic", "basil leaves", "broccoli", "yellow onion", "red bell pepper", "oyster sauce", "hoisin sauce", "fish sauce", "light soy sauce", "dark/sweet soy sauce", "corn starch", "msg", "sugar"], "cuisine": "thai", "ingredient_comment": "Thai basil stir fry recipe:\n\n*Serves ~6 people*\n\n*I eyeballed the ingredient amounts but will try and write approximations.*\n\nIngredients:\n\n* ~2.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs\n* ~20 cloves of garlic finely chopped, ground, or minced\n* 5-6 stalks worth of basil leaves (use holy basil or regular basil here)\n* 1-2 heads of broccoli\n* 1 yellow onion\n* 1 red bell pepper\n\n* Oyster sauce (~10 tbsp for marinade and another 4 tbsp for stir fry sauce)\n* 2 tbsp Hoisin sauce\n* 1 tsp Fish sauce\n* 1.5 tbsp Light soy sauce\n* 1.5 tbsp Dark/sweet soy sauce\n* A few pinches of corn starch\n* A few pinches of MSG if you have it although I forgot it this time and still tasted great\n* 1 tbsp sugar (also optional - the sauces already add some sweetness)\n\nProcedure:\n\nSlice the chicken into strips and then marinate in plenty of oyster sauce for at least 30 min to an hour but the longer the better.

Turn up the heat here to high and once the garlic starts to brown slightly, throw in all of your chopped-up veggies.  Fry the veggies until you see them start to brown and then turn down the heat to medium-low and throw in all of your sauces along with the chicken.  Throw in the corn starch, MSG, and sugar, give this a good mix, and cook on medium-low for a minute or two.  Finally, kill the heat or turn down to the lowest setting and add in the basil.

Welp, Vietnamese people eat FAR more than just pho or banh mi, and at home, food is oftentimes far simpler and humbler, like this simple preparation of Vietnamese garlicky roast chicken. \n\n  \nRoast chicken has thousands of iterations across cultures, but this is one of my absolute favorites, and it\u2019s sooo simple: it\u2019s got just six ingredients plus the chicken, and after 30 minutes roasting in the oven, you\u2019ve got a lip-smackingly luscious bird that will beg to have its juices sopped up with some rice!\n\n  \nTo watch my video on how to make this:\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90)  \n**Viet Garlicky Roast Chicken Recipe (adapted from Andrea Nguyen)**\u00a0\n\n  \n1 whole 3.5-4 lb chicken, preferably\u00a0organic and air-chilled,\u00a0spatchcocked (back bone removed with bird splayed flat), OR 3.5-4 lb chicken parts (thighs,\u00a0drumsticks, and wings)\u00a0\n\n  \n*Marinade ingredients:*\n\n* 4\u00a0whole garlic cloves,\u00a0minced finely\u00a0\n* 1 tsp black pepper\n* 1.5 tsp sugar\n* 1/4 tsp kosher salt\n* 1.5 Tbsp\u00a0neutral oil\n* 3.5 Tbsp Maggi seasoning\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Combine all sauce\u00a0ingredients into a bowl and mix well.\u00a0\n2.

Then, add the marinade sauce all\u00a0over\u00a0the chicken with your hands, making sure to get the sauce\u00a0between the meat\u00a0and the skin.\u00a0\n3. Refrigerate the chicken\u00a0and\u00a0allow to marinade for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor\u00a0penetration.\u00a0\n4. The next day, preheat oven to 500 F. Place spatchcocked\u00a0chicken on a cast iron roasting pan or roasting tray.\u00a0Place\u00a0chicken in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, checking about 5-10\u00a0min in to ensure the chicken isn\u2019t browning too quickly.

The quinoa &amp; garlic was also leftover from the prior day, but that can be cooked as needed as well.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 acorn squash\n* 1 cup of shredded chicken (or cooked ground chicken)\n* \u00bd cup cooked quinoa\n* 2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro\n* \u2153 squeezed lemon juice\n* \u00bd cup chopped walnuts\n* 2 cloves of roasted garlic\n* \u00bd cup blueberries\n* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar\n* \u2153 cup chopped feta cheese\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**", "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.9301757812, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "ForkAndPepper", "created_utc": 1601606089000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/3h8lirtx4lq51.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/j3lnpp/stuffed_acorn_squash/", "bbcgf_title": "Stuffed butternut squash", "calories": 430, "salt": 1.2998046875, "fat": 22.0, "sugars": 15.0, "saturates": 6.0, "carbs": 42.0, "protein": 13.0, "fibre": 6.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.8999023438}, {"id": "iqqlrg", "title": "Chipotle and Chicken Enchiladas", "gpt_ingredients": ["chicken breasts", "onion", "garlic cloves", "bell pepper", "tomatoes", "dried chipotle chillies", "salt", "provolone", "cheddar", "boiled water", "tortillas"], "cuisine": "mexican.", "ingredient_comment": "I know it's definitely not the sexiest enchilada but tasted great\n\n## Ingredients for 4-5 persons\n\n* 500gr of chicken breasts\n* 1 onion\n* 2 garlic cloves\n* 1 bell pepper\n* 2 tomatoes\n* 7 dried chipotle chillies\n* 2 teaspoons of salt\n* 150gr of provolone\n* 150gr of cheddar\n* Some boiled water\n* Some tortillas\n\n#", "score": 2140, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "NomNumNyum", "created_utc": 1599834980000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/4tlyjdyguim51.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/iqqlrg/chipotle_and_chicken_enchiladas/", "bbcgf_title": "Chicken & bean enchiladas", "calories": 484, "salt": 1.400390625, "fat": 12.0, "sugars": 14.0, "saturates": 5.0, "carbs": 54.0, "protein": 34.0, "fibre": 12.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9399414062}, {"id": "inbyoo", "title": "Maple Sriracha Chicken Wings", "gpt_ingredients": ["chicken wings", "neutral cooking oil", "paprika", "sugar", "salt", "garlic powder", "black pepper", "maple syrup", "sriracha", "scallion"], "cuisine": "asian", "ingredient_comment": "**Recipe here originally:** [**Maple Sriracha Chicken Wings**](http://triedtrue.us/MapleSrirachaWings)\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\n\nCook Time: 45 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 55 minutes \n\nServings: 4 people;

Preheat oven to 300\u00baF. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Pat the beef dry and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in batches in an even layer until very well-browned, about 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.\n\n**Cook the Aromatics:**\n\n1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the onions. Cook, stirring regularly, for 4-5 minutes until softened. Add 1 cup of the beef stock and scrape up all the browned bits stuck to bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and stir occasionally for 4-5 minutes until reduced slightly.\n2. Return the beef back to the pot and reduce heat to low. Add the remaining beef stock.\n3. Add the thyme, garlic halves (cut-side up) and the red Fresno pepper. Squeeze the juice from both orange halves over the beef and add the orange halves to the pot. Taste and season lightly with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Turn the heat off and cover the pot. Transfer to the oven for 2-3 hours until the beef is very tender.\n\n**Cook the Carrots:**\n\n1. Return the pot to the stove over medium heat. Remove and discard the orange and chili pepper. Remove the garlic from the pot. Once cool enough to handle, pop the cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste. Work the garlic paste back into the broth. Taste and season the broth to your preferences. Add the carrots and cook, covered, for 15-30 minutes on low heat until tender. Remove the cover and cook for 5-10 minutes over medium heat to allow the sauce in the pan to thicken.\n2. If needed, add a splash or two of water.

Then, remove it from the liquid, and shred it with your fingers. Mix the shredded beef with the fried sweet peppers, chopped parsley, tomato paste, chipotle paste and some of the meat cooking juices.\n\n**5.** Brush one side of the tortilla with olive oil and place it on a heated frying pan.

Then, keep it warm as you prepare the stir-fry.\n\n**Prepare the marinade:**\n\n* Gather all of the ingredients for the marinade except the cornstarch and beef in a large bowl. Stir until completely combined. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add the cornstarch and stir until smooth. Set aside.\n* Pat the beef dry and cut (with the grain) into 4-inch long pieces to make it easier to slice into strips. Next, cut the resulting beef pieces against the grain into \u00bd-inch wide strips. Cutting against the grain will yield the most tender beef, so be mindful of how you slice!\n* Add the beef to the bowl of marinade and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 15\u201330 minutes.\n\n**Cook the vegetables:**\n\n* Heat half the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the onion, snow peas, and red bell pepper. Cook in batches if needed. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the pepper begins to char and the snow peas are bright green and tender, about 5\u20137 minutes. Stir in the ginger and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.\n* Remove the vegetables from the skillet and transfer to a bowl.\n\n**Cook the beef:** \n\n* Add the remaining oil to the skillet over medium-high heat.  Once hot, pour in the beef with all of the marinade. A splatter screen will help with the sputtering! Spread the beef into an even layer. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes until the beef begins to brown and the marinade is bubbling.\n* Crank the heat during the first 3 minutes and watch it closely to develop a sear on the beef without burning the marinade. Then, adjust the heat back to medium-high. It will look like the sauce separates as it cooks, but don\u2019t worry!\n* After 3\u20134 minutes, flip the beef and continue cooking, often turning, for 2\u20134 minutes or until the beef is mostly cooked through.\n* Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and stir to develop a thick sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat and stir in the vegetables. Toss to coat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n* Arrange the cooked white rice on a serving platter and pile the stir-fried beef and vegetables on top. Garnish with cilantro, scallions, lime wedges, and crispy shallots.

Begin ladling in the warm water or stock, 1 cup at a time. Stir after each addition and only add more liquid once the rice absorbs the liquid in the pot. Continue adding the liquid until 5 cups have been incorporated. Taste the risotto to see if the rice is tender. The liquid in the pot should be creamy.

I used Stove Top pork)- Freshly ground Pepper\n\n\\- 2 tsp fresh thyme\n\n\\- 1 tsp parsley flakes\n\n\\- 1 tsp sage\n\n\\- 2 small shallots, very finely chopped\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the scotch eggs:\n\n\\- 6 medium eggs\n\n\\- 80g plain flower, seasoned with salt and pepper\n\n\\- 1 egg beaten\n\n\\- 3 slices of white bread, lightly toasted then ground into breadcrumbs\n\n\\- vegetable oil, for frying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Method**\n\n\\- Combine all the ingredients for the sausage meat together in a medium bowl, mix thoroughly. Meat can be covered and stored in fridge for later use.\n\n\\- Place the eggs, unbroken, in cold salted water. Bring to the boil then immediately reduce tempreature and simmer for 9 min. (You may have to do this in stages, if so you only need to let the water cool to warm between batches)\n\n\\- When the eggs are finished strain and cool under running water. Then peel off the shells, if you haven't done this before I recommend looking up a video, fingernails help.\n\n\\- Take the sausage meet and divide into sixths on a clean cutting board, before flattening each into a shallow oval \\~1/4\" thick.\n\n\\- Spread the seasoned flower onto a large plate. One at a time take a peeled egg and dredge it in flower until a thin coating sticks to all surfaces, before placing the egg at the center of the flattened sausage meat, and wrapping the meat around it and gently rolling to form a smooth egg shaped ball.\n\n\\- Prepare the breadcrumbs, I used a stick blender and a tall cup to get them fine enough. Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. One at a time coat the meat wrapped eggs in the beaten egg mixture before rolling in bread crumbs enough to ensure a even coating on all surfaces.\n\n\\- With all the eggs prepared select a high walled pot and fill with oil, quantity will vary based on pot selection but ideally should be enough to completely submerge the prepared egg. **Important:** Do not fill the pot anywhere near to full, remember when you place eggs in the oil level will rise and we do not want it to boil over. Heat the oil until a loose breadcrumb placed in it will bubble and brown in around 30s. (I found this was around 370F)\n\n\\- The eggs will be cooked for \\~9 min in the hot oil. I suggest using a slotted spoon to place and remove them. I encourage you to monitor the oil tempreature yourself, either by thermometer or look and feel and suggest you open up the first egg cooked and determine if any adjustments need to be made. It will all be relative to your setup but I cooked the eggs two at a time on alternating cycles, one egg removed every four and a half minutes, my oil temperature remained fairly constant at \\~320F, and I rotated the eggs twice to ensure even cooking.\n\n\\- **Important:** Usual safety precautions when working with hot oil apply, always use long implements to place eggs into the oil preferably from the side of the pot. Be aware of the temperament of the oil, sizzling is good bubbling is worrying. Be aware of the level of the oil as you add and remove the eggs. Finally as I was working in a small pot I took the step of turning off the gas every time I added a egg to prevent risk of flare up if the oil overflowed.\n\n\\- When the eggs are finished place them on a sheet of kitchen roll to absorb excess oil. Personal preference is to serve chilled or at room temperature, though they can be eaten warm after allowing some time to cool.  \n\n\n  \n**Improvements**  \nThis is probably the simplest least creative recipe for scotch eggs out there, I was deliberately aiming for generic. It does however make it completely open to adaptation/improvement. If I were to make it again I would definitely attempt to address the slightly bland breadcrumbs, I suspect the answer may be more salt but I also want to see if some herbs (perhaps sage) add some complexity to the flavor.", "score": 1874, "upvote_ratio": 0.9599609375, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "EminusVulneratis", "created_utc": 1633417037000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/ziwqu8xymkr71.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q1olns/scotch_eggs/", "bbcgf_title": "Scotch eggs", "calories": 590, "salt": 2.490234375, "fat": 41.0, "sugars": 2.0, "saturates": 12.0, "carbs": 27.0, "protein": 30.0, "fibre": 1.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.8999023438}, {"id": "nrt4c5", "title": "Char Siu Pulled Pork", "gpt_ingredients": ["bone-in skinless pork shoulder", "garlic", "ginger", "green onion", "hoisin sauce", "rice wine", "honey", "soy sauce", "white pepper", "star anise powder", "red food dye"], "cuisine": "chinese", "ingredient_comment": "I made this pulled pork in the oven low and slow.

For the top-quality meat, pigs are raised in an organic setting, fed with a variety of fruit, grass, grains and vegetables. Papaya is their most beloved feed on the menu giving the pork a unique flavour. Almost all parts of the animal are used for recipe ranging from ears, cheeks, main body to offal.\n\nTo prepare Cochinitas at home I choose Pork shoulder as my preference.

Before beginning, prepare the leek as it takes the most time. Halve the leek lengthwise and very thinly slice both halves into 1/8-inch wide slivers. You may need to separate some of the layers of the leek and slice each layer separately. If you find bits of dirt deep within the leek, don\u2019t fret. You can place all the leek slivers in a sieve and rinse again once more to remove any stubborn flecks of dirt.\n2. Transfer the sliced leek to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry to remove any excess water.\n\n**Steep the saffron:**\n\n1. Place the crushed saffron in a small bowl and cover it with 2 tablespoons of hot water. Set aside.\n\n**Prepare the guanciale chili oil:**\n\n1. Place the guanciale in a large pot (you\u2019ll use this pot later for the orzo and cod!) and turn the heat to medium. Cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes crispy.\n2. Add the shallot, garlic, and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional 3 minutes, turning often and adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the garlic from browning. Once the shallot softens, and the garlic takes on a very light golden color, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Scoop out all but a tablespoon of the fat from the pot and add it to the bowl of guanciale.\n3. Pour the extra virgin olive oil, chili oil, and maple syrup over the guanciale. Stir vigorously to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add more maple syrup, chili oil, or crushed red pepper, depending on your preferences.\n4. The guanciale oil will keep in an airtight jar for up to 5 days.\n\n**Prepare the saffron cod and orzo:**\n\n1. Pat the cod dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Return the pot of remaining guanciale fat to medium heat. Add the sliced fennel bulb and stalks along with the sliced shallot. Season with salt and cook for 5\u20136 minutes until the fennel begins to soften.\n3. Add the garlic and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until just fragrant.\n4. Melt the butter into the pot and add the orzo. Stir to coat and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until it begins to lightly toast. Season with salt.\n5. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil for 2\u20133 minutes. Stir often to lift up any orzo that may have stuck to the bottom.\n6. Reduce heat to low and arrange the cod on top. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Drizzle the steeped saffron mixture all over, ensuring that each piece of cod gets a little bit of saffron water.\n7. Cover and simmer over low heat for 12\u201315 minutes or until the cod is opaque and the orzo is tender.\n\n**Frizzle the leek:**\n\n1. *Note: Use a saucepan that has somewhat high sides. Generally, you want a saucepan that\u2019s at least 6\u20138 inches deep. When you add the leeks to the hot oil, the oil will foam up vigorously, and you do NOT want it pouring over the edges.*\n2. As the cod simmers, make the leeks. In a saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Break off a piece of leek and add it to the pot; if it bubbles rapidly, it\u2019s ready to fry.\n3. Working in small batches, add a handful of the leeks at a time to the oil. Stir occasionally and fry for 15\u201320 seconds until golden brown. Remove and\u2013using tongs\u2013transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue on until all the leeks are fried. Pat any excess oil off from the tops of the leeks with a paper towel and season with flaky sea salt. Set aside.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1.

The rice takes about 50 minutes to prepare, but has a lot of hands-off time. The salmon and veggies for this meal can be prepared as the rice cooks. Optionally, you can substitute plain white rice to make this recipe as a poke bowl instead.\n2. Place the rice in a large pot (that has a lid). Rinse and drain the rice until the water runs clear, at least 3 times (rinse the rice even if the bag says it's \"prewashed\"). Drain as much water as possible.\n3. Add 1 3/4 cup lukewarm water to the pot, close with the lid, and place on the stove top.\n4. Heat over medium-high heat until the water begins to boil, once boiling cook over medium-high heat for 4 minutes, then reduce heat to very-low and simmer for 15 minutes.\n5. After simmering, remove from heat and let the pot stand undisturbed for another 15 minutes.\n6. Scoop the rice into a large non-metallic bowl. Dust with sugar and salt, then pour over the rice vinegar. Using a rice spatula or non-stick spatula mix everything together and break up all the clumps of rice. Mix until every grain of rice is separated and coated in vinegar, the sugar and salt should dissolve completely. Don't worry if the rice seems too wet at this point, that will go away as it cools.\n7. Allow the rice to cool uncovered, mixing occasionally, until it reaches room temp (about 15 minutes). You can speed this process along by fanning the rice if desired. The rice should be slightly sticky once it's cooled.\n\n**To Prepare Veggies:**\n\n1.

Simply place your beetroots in a baking tray, cover with aluminum foil and place inside a pre heated oven on 180\\*C.\n\n2)Bake the beetroots until fork tender (piercing a fork inside without applying any pressure). Time may vary from 45 minutes to 2 hours.\n\n3)Once fork tender, peel the skin off, dice the beets roughly and blend with a stix mixer.  \nyour beatiful beetroot puree is now ready to use!\n\nFor the garnish:\n\n1)Place your cheese, olive oil and salt into a shallow mixing bowl and blend well with a stix mixer.\n\n2)Pass the creamy mixture through a fine sieve to assure a more stable texture.\n\n3)Mix well with the orange zest and set aside for further use.\n\nFor the risotto:\n\n1)Start by preparing the rice. Take a skillet or shallow pot and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your rice.\n\n2)Stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes until the edges of the grain start becoming translucent.\n\n3)Now that we build a protective layer around the grain, pour in your water and stir frequently until all the water has evaporated.\n\n4)Transfer the rice onto a tin, and let cool.\n\n5)Once cool, your rice is ready to use. This is a neat little step worth making when cooking risotto as it helps release more of that starchy goodness later on when cooking the risotto. Par-cooked rice like this can last up to a week in a food container in your fridge and will greatly shorten your time preparing risotto.\n\n6)Now take your skillet and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your diced onions.\n\n7)Saute the onions until soft and translucent. It will probably take in between 7-10 minutes.\n\n8)Once your onions are beautifully tender, add in your finely minced garlic and stir for another minute.\n\n9)Now add in your rice and season with salt and pepper. (This is the perfect time to add salt as it will drain any extra juices which will be absorbed by the rice.)\n\n10)Stir constantly for another minute or two and proceed to pour in your wine.\n\n11)Keep stirring (from this moment on, you\u2019ll have to be stirring most of the time as more motion the rice makes, the more starch it releases, creating a creamy texture.) until all the wine has evaporated.\n\n12)Now that your wine has evaporated, add 3 tablespoons of your beetroot pure and stir until incorporated.  \n\n\n13)Now start adding your vegetable stock (hot! so it doesn\u2019t prevent the rice from continuing to cook.) a little at a time as the rice absorbs the liquid. The reason you don\u2019t pour it all at the same time is because you don\u2019t know how much liquid the rice will absorb.  \n\n\n14)When the rice is cooked al-dente\u00a0 it should still have a slightly \u201crunny to watery\u201d texture, we don\u2019t want it thick.\n\n15)Now turn off the heat and add the butter, preferably room temperature so it blends more quickly\n\n16)Once you add the butter, now is the time to really work your hand, and give the rice a good beating, stirring it vigorously until all the butter has blended with the dish.  \n\n\n17)After the butter has blended add the parmesan cheese and beat again, this time not as vigorously until the cheese has melted.", "score": 114, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Fruit\\Vegetarian", "author": "Zamezi", "created_utc": 1610287492000, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kuezx3", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kuezx3/beetroot_risotto_with_creamy_goat_cheese/", "bbcgf_title": "Beetroot risotto with feta", "calories": 727, "salt": 1.900390625, "fat": 24.0, "sugars": 19.0, "saturates": 9.0, "carbs": 93.0, "protein": 22.0, "fibre": 8.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9599609375}, {"id": "kqanau", "title": "Black Bean Veggie Dip", "gpt_ingredients": ["corn", "black beans", "bell peppers", "avocados", "cilantro", "shallot", "lime", "olive oil", "salt", "pepper", "jalapeno", "garlic", "spices"], "cuisine": "mexican", "ingredient_comment": "https://www.onehealthypickle.com/2021/01/black-bean-veggie-dip.html?fbclid=IwAR0aessam4-dHWvG4drf7Sb3IuMG8SkxhLfRc0FgJZEsn2HhPJKeU1fDIUY&amp;m=1\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 can corn\n\n1 can black beans rinsed\n\n2 bell peppers (I prefer red) diced\n\n2 avocados diced\n\n1 bunch cilantro (go organic, it tastes remarkably better) chopped\n\n1 shallot minced\n\n1 lime (I substituted a lemon)\n\n1-2 tbsp. olive oil\n\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\noptional: jalapeno, garlic, spices", "score": 3400, "upvote_ratio": 0.9702148438, "link_flair_text": "Fruit\\Vegetarian", "author": "aekearne", "created_utc": 1609773369000, "url": "https://i.redd.it/b45mmys61c961.jpg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kqanau/black_bean_veggie_dip/", "bbcgf_title": "Avocado & cannellini bean dip", "calories": 194, "salt": 0.3000488281, "fat": 14.0, "sugars": 1.0, "saturates": 2.0, "carbs": 10.0, "protein": 5.0, "fibre": 5.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.8999023438}, {"id": "kowilc", "title": "Chilli Non-Carne With Roasted Peppers", "gpt_ingredients": ["quorn mince", "peppers", "red chillies", "onions", "celery stick", "garlic cloves", "red kidney beans", "seasoned tomato sauce with chopped tomatoes", "canola oil", "sugar", "salt", "paprika", "mild chilli powder", "ground cumin", "oregano", "grounded clove"], "cuisine": "mexican", "ingredient_comment": "I love spicy food and this recipe suits people who do and those who don't.
